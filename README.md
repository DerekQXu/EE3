# EE3-Project-NATCAR
Final project for EE3 - Introduction to Electrical Engineering. Designed and created an autonomous line following robot (black electrical tape on white background), using infrared sensors. Utilized PID algorithm and H-bridge controls to implement path following. Extra Credit: code also lights up LED when magnet detected using hall-effect sensor. 
# Results
Car successfully navigated a 10 foot straight in ~10 seconds and 3 foot radius loop in ~9 seconds.
